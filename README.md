# Traffic-System-Management-with-Arduino-and-YOLO
This project builds a Traffic System Management solution using Arduino and YOLO for real-time vehicle detection. It integrates hardware (ESP32, sensors) with a pre-trained YOLO model and Python scripts for traffic control. The system is designed for efficient vehicle tracking and logging for monitoring and debugging.
